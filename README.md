# ECG Anomaly Detection on Edge Devices â€“ TinyML & Machine Learning Approaches

This repository contains a self-made summary and recreation of the research paper: **["Reliable ECG Anomaly Detection on Edge Devices for Internet of Medical Things Applications"](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/8/2496)**. The project focuses on **ECG anomaly detection** using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset, comparing classic machine learning models and deep learning (CNN), and exploring TinyML deployment concepts for edge devices.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Continuous ECG monitoring is essential for early detection of cardiac anomalies. This repository demonstrates two aspects:

1. **Machine Learning Models for ECG Classification**  
   - Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CNN  
   - Trained and evaluated on the MIT-BIH dataset  
   - Comparison of metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) with reference results from the paper  

2. **Summary and insights from the original research paper**  
   - TinyML pipeline for deployment on edge devices (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)  
   - Model optimization using pruning and quantization  
   - Real-time ECG anomaly detection with low-power consumption
